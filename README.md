# On Variational Bounds of Mutual Information

Presentation I made for the Advanced Topics in Machine Learning seminar in Fall Semester 2019. While I mainly talked about [Poole et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06922) paper, I also tried to include some discussion from recent work of [Tschannen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13625).

ETH Zurich presentation templates can be found [here](https://ethz.ch/services/en/service/communication/corporate-design/templates-for-creative-design/presentation.html) (needs auth). I used [IguanaTex](http://www.jonathanleroux.org/software/iguanatex/) PowerPoint add-in for typing math equations in  LaTeX.
